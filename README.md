# Information about project
As we can see, this web-map shows us ten the nearest places where films of the given year were filmed. Every marker has a short description (you can see it after clicking on it) about each movie (name of the film and year). Also, there are some additional layers that you can toggle by the button above. These allow you to see the distance between the given place and the place of filming and the area of filming.
